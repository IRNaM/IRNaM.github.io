      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Puzzle 9:&nbsp;</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">up is on</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate to say it, but I might be beaten.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have this image and use it as the last 5 digits, thats all puzzle 9 is: reaching the end. Puzzle 10 is then decifering what <strong>I R N a M.</strong> is, from its origin story is the final puzzle, but I have faith you can solve it.</p>
